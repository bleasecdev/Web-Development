            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>I began my journey into web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create static web pages, 
                and later learned back-end programming languages like Python and Node.js, which allowed me to create dynamic websites and handle user input. I enjoy bringing my clients 
                ideas to life. Continuously learning and growing, I stay up-to-date with new technologies and best practices to improve my skills as a web developer.</p>

            <h3>Machine Learning</h3>
            <p>I became interested in machine learning during my computer science studies, where I learned the theory and concepts behind it. 
                I studied supervised and unsupervised learning techniques, 
                and gained experience with popular libraries such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn. Machine learning is a fast-paced and constantly evolving field, and I 
                strive to keep up-to-date with the latest research and techniques to improve my skills as a practitioner. 
                Through ongoing learning and experimentation, I aim to develop innovative solutions that can make a 
                meaningful impact in various industries and domains.</p>

            <h3>Real Estate and Finance</h3>
            <p>My passion for real estate and finance has allowed me to give back to my community by assisting first-time homebuyers and investors in 
                finding real estate that fits their lifestyle and financial means. For over half a decade, I've been providing this service part-time, 
                and I'm happy to continue doing so.
